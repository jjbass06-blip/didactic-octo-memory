Overview of intention:
To explore audio editing in relation to AI voice delivery:
  1) Consider existing models (using Piper models hosted at Hugging Face)
  3) Record a custom vocal set
  4) Train a new model using Google Collab
  5) Seek to enhance phrasing and feel (markup and editing of amplitude / formant / modulation )
