On first testing the voice files I loaded en/british/Cori and found issues with the "th" sound. 

Using the word "this" at the start of a sentence produced an inaccurate pronnunciation as did the word "three"

The pace and phrasing although good was not natural in places with emphasis not cosistent.

Proposal: to record my own voice samples and to train my own voice model usinf my voice and high quality recordings.

Note: with my professional audio recording background I was quite surprised by how low the quality of some of the compiled voicemodels were. I understand the need for saving proecssing power with lower bitrate and sample rate recordings but this needs to balance with the quality of the voice.
